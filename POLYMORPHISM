POLYMORPHISM: -poly->many
               morphism->forms
              -if one thing exist in more than one form that is called POLYMORPHISM.
              -helps in reducing complexity and length of code

1.OPERATOR OVERLOADING- In a complex class of two numbers you have to overload     
                        operator to add two complex number and have to define
                        the functionality.

2.FUNCTION OVERLOADING- when there are different functions with same names but 
                        but different type or number of arguments.  

VIRTUAL FUNCTION- when we have same function in base and derived class .
                  To avoid confusion while compiling we add virtual keyword to the 
                  base class function.
                - the function with virtual keyword can not be called.
