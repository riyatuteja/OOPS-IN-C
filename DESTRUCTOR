DESTRUCTOR - special member function that destroys the object of the class created 
             by the constructor
           - automatically called when the object goes out of scope
           - neither require any arguments nor any return value, therefore can't be 
             overloaded
           - declared as static and const.  
           - can only be used once and in the public section of the program with 
             (~) symbol  
           SYNTAX: //inside ~class_name(){}
                   //outside class_name : :class_name(){}

                IMPORTANT QUESTION
                Q: What are the functions that are generated by the compiler by default,
                   if we do not provide them explicitly?
               Ans: he functions that are generated by the compiler by default if 
                    we do not provide them explicitly are:
                    I. Default constructor
                    II. Copy constructor
                    III. Assignment operator
                    IV. Destructor
