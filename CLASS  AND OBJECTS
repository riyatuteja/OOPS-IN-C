CLASS : -The building block of c++ that leads to object oriented programming.
       -A class is a user defined data type, which holds its own data members and member functions,
        which can be accessed when an instance of a class is created.
       -A class is a blueprint for an object.
       -Data members are the data variables and member functions are the functions used to 
        manipulate the  variables , together these data variables and member functions define
        the properties and behaviour of an object of class.

        // class declaration
         class class_name
         {
            //data members
            // member functions
         };
         SUB-CLASSES :  class derived from public base class.
         class sub-class_name : public class_name
         {
            
         }
OBJECT : -Instance of a class with similar properties and behaviour.
         -when a class is created no memory is allocated but when it is instanciated (i.e an object
         is created)the memory is allocated    

         int main()
         {
            // create an object
            class_name object_name;
         } 

ACCESS MODIFIERS IN CLASS 
-used to implement an important aspect of oops called data hiding.
-assign the accessibility to the class members i.e set some restrictions ont the 
class member so that they can not directly be accessed by the outside function.

TYPES

PUBLIC: available for everyone (other classes and functions ,anywhere in the program 
        using member accesss operator(.)with obejct of the class)

PRIVATE: only accessed by the member function of its own class or the friend 
         function.

PROTECTED: similar to private but can be access outside the class using 
           friends function and sub classes
