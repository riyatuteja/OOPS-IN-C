           BASE CLASS- the class being inherited
           - only protected and public part is inherited

           TYPES OF INHERITANCE
1.SINGLE INHERITANCE-   CLASS A <- CLASS B
2.MULTIPLE INHERITANCE- CLASS A CLASS B
                            \    /
                             \  /
                            CLASS C
3. MULTILEVEL INHERITANCE- CLASS A<-CLASS B<-CLASS C 
4. HYBRID INHERITANCE- CLASS A->CLASS B
                        \
                        CLASS C<-CLASS D
5. HEIRARCHICAL INHERITANCE-  CLASS A CLASS B CLASS J CLASS K
                                 \    /       /       /
