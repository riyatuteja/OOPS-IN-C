CLASS - The building block in c++ that leads to object oriented programming, is a class.
      - User defined data type that hold its own data members and member functions,which can be accessed by creating an instance of
        the class.Data members are the data variables and member functions are the functions used to manipulate these variables and
        together these data members and member functions define the properties and behaviour of the objects in a Class.
      - A class is Blueprint for an object which shares some common properties and behaviours.
      
                            //class declaration
                            class CLASSNAME{
                              //class data
                               ...
                               ...};
      Classes have objects which have the same data type as defined in the class.
     
OBJECTS - Instance of a class ,have the same data type as defined in class.
        - When a class is defined no memory is allocated but when a class is instantiated  (i.e. an object is created) memory is 
          allocated.
                            class person{
                            char name[20];
                            int age;
                            
                            public:
                             void getdetails()
                             {
                             }
                             };
                             int main()
                             {
                              person p1; // p1 is an object
                              }
